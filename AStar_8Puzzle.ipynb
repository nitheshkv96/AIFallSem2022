    "An A* Algorithm is developed to solve the 8-puzzle problem considering the windy situation using modified manhattan distance as the heuristic function h(n) and accumulated cost incurred for every move taken as g(n) with respect to the windy situation specified in the problem statement. The total cost is formulated as the sum of h(n) and g(n) and this is used as the evaluation function to maneuver the agent through the 8-puzzle grid to achieve the goal state, optimally."
